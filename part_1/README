Assignment 2, Part 1: Driving Route Finder

1. Included Files

    * dijkstra.cpp
    * server.cpp
    * digraph.cpp
    * dijkstra.h
    * heap.h
    * server.h
    * digraph.h
    * wdigraph.h
    * Makefile

2. Accessories

    None

3. Wiring Instructions

    None

4. Running Instructions

    In the directory containing the included files, in addition to the digraph implementation and header files (digraph.cpp, digraph.h, wdigraph.h), enter the following command into the bash terminal to build the program:

        make

    After the program is finished compiling and linking, enter the following command into the bash terminal to run the program:

        ./server

    To make a query for the route finder, enter the query in the following format in the bash terminal:

        R <start_lat> <start_lon> <end_lat> <end>lon>

    replaceing each term enclosed in <> braces with an integer value of the latitude and longitude in 100,000ths of a degree. The program will respond with the number of waypoints in the shortest path from the start coordinates to the end coordinates. To print individual waypoints, enter the following command in the bash terminal:

        A

    Continue entering the command to get additional waypoints. Once all waypoints are exhausted (and the end coordinates reached), the program will return 'E' and exit.

5. Notes and Assumptions

    The user will always input a correct file.

    CMPUT 275 headers were excluded from the digraph.cpp, digraph.h, and wdigraph.h files, as they were provided by the course instructors (and were not modified in any way).
